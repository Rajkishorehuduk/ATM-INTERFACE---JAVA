# ATM-INTERFACE---JAVA
This Java-based ATM simulation project allows users to log in with a user ID and PIN, view account details, and perform basic banking operations like transfers. It uses multiple classes (ATM, User, Account, BankSystem, Transaction) to mimic real-world modular banking logic in an object-oriented way. Great for beginners learning OOP.
